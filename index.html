                  originates from mobile devices. Modern web design ensures that
                  websites are mobile-friendly, enhancing accessibility and user
                  satisfaction, which can lead to increased traffic and engagement.
                  We emphasize that no design is complete without responsiveness.

              <p>
                My name is Anas Ahmed and I have been dabbling in
                <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span> since 2008, but my true
                development journey began in 2020 during the pandemic. Faced with
                a personal project and unable to get help from a friend who was a
                professional developer, I decided to dive into coding myself. This
                experience ignited my passion for web development. Although I came
                from a chemical manufacturing family business and always thought I
                enjoyed it, I discovered a strong pull towards coding. It felt
                like coding gave me wings.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 2020 to 2024, I dedicated myself to learning
                <span>Node, Python, and PHP</span>, creating several personal
                projects along the way, such as arcade games in Python, a project
                manager in PHP, and a General Knowledge challenge in Node, to name
                a few. The turning point came in early 2024 when a client from our
                family business asked me to build a website for them. It was then
                that I realized I couldn't live without coding. So, I made the
                bold decision to leave the family business and fully immerse
                myself in web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am deeply passionate about coding and love creating modern,
                responsive web solutions. Whether it's developing complex
                applications or designing intuitive user interfaces, I am
                committed to delivering high-quality work that meets my clients'
                needs.
